{{- /* The template for THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md (make licenses, ADR-0013).

It lists what the binary links, with the licence each dependency carries and a link to the text.

whose licence forbids that would make the conversion impossible - so the list is also the record

# Third-party licences

Hubtask itself is licensed under BUSL-1.1 (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)) and converts to Apache-2.0
three years after each version's first public distribution ([ADR-0013](./docs/adr/ADR-0013-licensing.md)).

The dependencies below are what the binaries link. None of them carries a copyleft licence, which
is what the `gate-licenses` build gate enforces on every pull request: a GPL or AGPL dependency
would make both the commercial licence and the promised conversion impossible.

This file is generated - run `make licenses` rather than editing it.

## Bundled assets

Not linked into the binary, but shipped with it: the typeface the interface is set in, and the
icons it is drawn with. Both are served from this repository rather than from a foreign domain, so
that a self-hosted Hubtask contacts nobody when it loads
([ADR-0029](./docs/adr/ADR-0029-design-system-tokens.md),
`docs/design/design-system.md` §3, [ADR-0041](./docs/adr/ADR-0041-icon-set.md)).

| Asset | Licence |
|---|---|
| [IBM Plex Sans](https://github.com/IBM/plex/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) (variable) | OFL-1.1 |
| [IBM Plex Sans Condensed](https://github.com/IBM/plex/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) | OFL-1.1 |
| [IBM Plex Mono](https://github.com/IBM/plex/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) | OFL-1.1 |
| [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/blob/main/LICENSE) (the declared subset) | ISC |

The font files come from the `@fontsource` packages the pnpm lockfile pins; those packages
repackage the upstream release and are themselves MIT, while the typeface stays under the SIL Open
Font License 1.1. OFL is copyleft for *fonts* - a modified font must keep the licence and change
its name - and it places no condition whatever on software that merely embeds or displays one, so
it does not touch the conversion the paragraph above is about.

The icons come from `lucide-static`, which is a *development* dependency: `packages/design-system/build/icons.js`
generates the declared subset into the repository, so what ships is those shapes and not the
package. ISC is permissive with one obligation - keep the notice, which is this row. Lucide is
itself a fork of Feather (MIT), and its LICENSE carries both notices.
